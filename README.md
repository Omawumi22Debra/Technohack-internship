###  Project Overview
This is a data analysis project aimed to provide insights on food consumption. By analysing the various types of products and categories consumed in each quarter of the year and gaining a deeper understanding of sales and consumption rate.

### Data Sources
Food consumption: the primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Food consumption dataset1.csv" containing detailed information about the products, categories and sales.

### Tools
- Excel - Data source & cleaning
- [Download here(https://microsoft.com)]
- Pivot table- Data analysis

  ### Data cleaning/Preparation
  In the initial data preparation, i performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling blank cells
3. Data cleaning and filtering.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- The Eda involved exploring the food consumption data to answer key questions such as:
- What are the overall total sales for the product and category?
- What are the top 10 products sold?
- What are the average sales for the product for each quarter?
- what are the last 10 products sold for each quarter?
- What are the top 5 categories sold?
- What are the top 5 categories sold in each quarter?

  ### Results/Findings
  The analysis results are as follows:
1. The top 5 categories encouraged the sales of products in the subcategory to increase noticeably in each quarter.
2. Products with low sales should be targeted for marketing effort to encourage sales for both categories and products.

 ###  Recommendations
  Based on the analysis we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions for products in all quarter to maximise revenue.
- Focusing and expanding products in low categories.
- Implement a consumer segmentation strategy to target a high sale for the low products.

  ### Limitations
  I had to remove all blank cells, so it wonâ€™t affect the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis.
